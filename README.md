# Timer

A fast command-line countdown timer with live terminal feedback, graceful cancellation,
and optional completion alarms.

## Features

- Live countdown display in terminal status output (`stderr`) and title bar (when supported)
- Graceful cancellation via Ctrl+C
- Audio alert on completion (best-effort, platform-specific backend)
- Wall clock target mode: count down to a time of day in 24-hour or 12-hour AM/PM format
- Optional `-q`/`--quiet` mode for inline countdown only
- Optional `-s`/`--sound` to force alarm playback on completion
- Optional `-c`/`--caffeinate` to force sleep-inhibition attempt in non-TTY mode (macOS only)
- Ceiling-based display (never shows 00:00:00 while time remains)
- Non-TTY lifecycle logging by default (`started`/`complete`/`cancelled`)
- Clean, minimal interface

## Quick Start

Install and run in under a minute:

```bash
brew tap Mtn-Man/tools
brew install Mtn-Man/tools/timer
timer --help
timer 10m
```

If `timer` is not found after install, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Platform Support

- Prebuilt release binaries are published for tested platforms: macOS and Linux
  (`amd64` and `arm64`).
- BSD systems are expected to work when building from source, but prebuilt BSD
  binaries are not currently published.
- Windows is currently unsupported.

## Installation

### Install With Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap Mtn-Man/tools
brew install Mtn-Man/tools/timer
```

Verify:
```bash
timer --version
```

### Install Prebuilt Release Binary (Tested Platforms: macOS/Linux)

1. Download your platform archive and `checksums.txt` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/Mtn-Man/timer/releases/latest).
   Replace `<version>` in the examples below with the release tag
   (for example, `vX.Y.Z`).
   Archive naming pattern:
   - `timer_<version>_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`
   - `timer_<version>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz`
   - `timer_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz`
   - `timer_<version>_linux_arm64.tar.gz`
   Note: release filenames use `darwin` to refer to macOS.
   The examples below use macOS Apple Silicon filenames; swap in the archive
   and binary names for your OS/architecture.
2. Open a terminal and change to the folder where you downloaded the release files
   (for example, `~/Downloads`):
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
3. Verify checksum (optional but recommended):
   Example for macOS Apple Silicon:
   ```bash
   grep "timer_<version>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz$" checksums.txt | shasum -a 256 -c -
   ```
   Example for Linux:
   ```bash
   grep "timer_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz$" checksums.txt | sha256sum -c -
   ```
4. Extract your archive (example shown for macOS Apple Silicon):
   ```bash
   tar -xzf timer_<version>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
   ```
5. Install the extracted binary into `/usr/local/bin` (default):
   ```bash
   sudo install -m 0755 timer_darwin_arm64 /usr/local/bin/timer
   ```
   If you are on a different platform, replace the archive and binary filenames
   above with the matching release files for your OS/architecture.
6. Alternative (no `sudo`): install to `~/.local/bin`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   install -m 0755 timer_darwin_arm64 ~/.local/bin/timer
   ```
   If `~/.local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, add it to your shell startup file
   (for example, `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`), then reload your shell:
   ```bash
   # zsh
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc

   # bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
7. Verify:
   ```bash
   timer --version
   ```

### Install With Go

Prerequisite: Go 1.20+ installed. Get Go: https://go.dev/dl/

Install the latest version:
```bash
go install github.com/Mtn-Man/timer@latest
```

Or install a specific release:
```bash
go install github.com/Mtn-Man/timer@<version>
```

Or clone and build locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mtn-Man/timer.git
cd timer
go build -o timer .
./timer --version
```

Build with an injected version (recommended for releases):
```bash
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=vX.Y.Z" -o timer .
./timer --version
```

For local source builds without `-ldflags`, `--version` reports `timer dev`.
When installed with `go install github.com/Mtn-Man/timer@<version>`, `--version`
typically reports that module version.

## Usage
```bash
timer [options] <duration>
timer [options] <time>
timer --help
timer --version
timer --quiet <duration>
timer --sound <duration>
timer --sound-file <path> <duration>
timer -f <path> <duration>
timer -s <duration>
timer --caffeinate <duration>
timer -c <duration>
timer -qs <duration>
timer -- <duration>
```

For ergonomics, options may be placed before or after the duration operand
(for example, `timer -q 5m` and `timer 5m -q` are both supported).
You can also combine short flags such as `-qs`.

### Examples
```bash
timer 30s       # 30 seconds
timer 30        # 30 seconds (bare numbers are seconds)
timer 5m        # 5 minutes
timer 1.5h      # 1.5 hours
timer 0.5       # 500 milliseconds
timer 90m       # 90 minutes
timer 14:30     # count down to 2:30 PM today (or tomorrow if already past)
timer 9:00      # count down to 9:00 AM today (or tomorrow if already past)
timer 9am       # count down to 9:00 AM (12-hour shorthand)
timer 2:30pm    # count down to 2:30 PM
timer 9:30:30am # count down to 9:30:30 AM
timer "2:30 PM" # space-separated AM/PM suffix (quotes required)
timer 12pm      # count down to noon
timer 12am      # count down to midnight
timer --help    # Show help
timer -v        # Show version (e.g. timer dev or timer vX.Y.Z)
timer -q 5m     # Quiet mode: inline countdown only
timer -s 5m     # Force alarm playback even in quiet/non-TTY mode
timer -qs 5m    # Inline countdown + alarm, no title bar updates
timer --sound 5m                              # Force alarm even in quiet/non-TTY mode
timer --sound-file ~/Sounds/bell.mp3 5m       # Play custom sound on completion
timer -f ~/Sounds/bell.mp3 5m                 # Play custom sound (short flag)
timer -f /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff 5  # macOS: play a built-in alert sound
timer -f "~/Music/Alarm Sounds/bell.mp3" 5m  # Quoted path with spaces
timer -c 10m 2> /tmp/timer.log                # Force macOS sleep inhibition in non-TTY
timer -- 10s    # End option parsing; treat following token as positional duration
timer -- --help # Treat --help as positional token (invalid duration)
timer 10m 2> /tmp/timer.status               # Capture lifecycle output
```

The timer accepts any duration format supported by Go's `time.ParseDuration`,
including combinations like `1h30m` or `2h15m30s`. Bare integers and decimals
(for example `30`, `0.5`, `.5`) are also accepted and treated as seconds.

In wall clock mode, pass a time of day instead of a duration. The timer counts
down to the next occurrence of that time, wrapping to the following day if it has
already passed. 24-hour (`14:30`) and 12-hour AM/PM formats (`2:30pm`, `"2:30 PM"`)
are both supported, as are bare hour shorthands (`9am`). `12am` is midnight and
`12pm` is noon.

### Flags

- `-h`, `--help`: Show help and exit
- `-v`, `--version`: Show version and exit (reports injected build version, module
  version when available, or `timer dev` for local non-injected builds)
- `-q`, `--quiet`: TTY: inline countdown only (no title bar updates, completion line,
  alarm, or cancel text). Non-TTY: suppress lifecycle status output. Combine with
  `-s` (`-qs`) to keep the alarm while still suppressing the title bar.
- `-s`, `--sound`: Force alarm playback on completion even in `--quiet` or non-TTY mode
- `-f`, `--sound-file <path>`: Path to a custom audio file to play on completion
  (implies `--sound`; supported on macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD). If the file cannot
  be resolved or used, the timer falls back to the default alarm backend.
  OpenBSD/NetBSD always use the default alarm backend.
- `-c`, `--caffeinate`: Force sleep-inhibition attempt even in non-TTY mode (macOS only)
- `--`: End option parsing; all following tokens are treated as positional arguments

## Requirements

- Go 1.20+ required only for building from source
- A Unix-like OS (macOS, Linux, or BSD) for source builds
- Prebuilt binaries are currently published for macOS/Linux only

## Troubleshooting

- `timer` not found after install (`timer: command not found`): Ensure your install
  location is in `PATH` (`/opt/homebrew/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` for Homebrew,
  `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` or `GOBIN` for `go install`, `/usr/local/bin` or
  `~/.local/bin` for manual install), then restart or reload your shell.
- `Permission denied` while installing to `/usr/local/bin`: Use `sudo install ...`
  or install to `~/.local/bin` instead.
- Homebrew command ambiguity with the existing `timer` cask: use
  `brew install Mtn-Man/tools/timer` and `brew info Mtn-Man/tools/timer`.
- `timer --version` shows `timer dev`: This is expected for local source builds
  without `-ldflags "-X main.version=vX.Y.Z"` (for example, `go build .`).

## How It Works

Run-mode status output is written to `stderr`, leaving `stdout` clean for
pipeline use.

In interactive status mode (`stderr` is a TTY), the timer updates every 500ms in
`HH:MM:SS` format, updating both the terminal line and title bar (when terminal
capabilities allow it). With `-q` / `--quiet`, the title bar update is suppressed
and only the inline countdown is shown.

In normal interactive mode, completion prints `timer complete`, plays an alert
using the best available backend for your platform, and exits.

With `-q` / `--quiet` in interactive mode, completion and cancellation text are
also suppressed, and no alarm plays on completion.

When `stderr` is not a TTY (for example, redirected), the timer emits
lifecycle-only status lines: `timer: started (...)`, `timer: complete`, and
`timer: cancelled`. With `--quiet`, those non-TTY lifecycle lines are suppressed.

Default alarm playback requires both `stdout` and `stderr` to be TTYs. If either
stream is piped or redirected, alarm does not auto-run unless explicitly requested
with `--sound`. When `--sound` is provided, alarm playback is still attempted on
completion in `--quiet` and non-TTY modes.

On macOS, default sleep inhibition is attempted only when both `stdout` and `stderr`
are TTYs. In that interactive mode, timer uses `caffeinate -i -d -w <pid>` to also
keep the display awake. With `--caffeinate`, timer also attempts sleep inhibition in
non-TTY/piped runs (best effort), but uses `caffeinate -i -w <pid>` (no `-d`).
On non-macOS systems, `--caffeinate` prints a warning and continues without
sleep inhibition.

Press Ctrl+C at any time to cancel the timer gracefully. In interactive normal mode,
the current line is cleared and `timer cancelled` is printed, then the process exits
with code 130. In non-TTY normal mode, `timer: cancelled` is emitted. In `--quiet`
mode, cancellation text is suppressed. If the process receives SIGTERM, it exits
with code 143.

Note that in normal interactive mode, the terminal title bar may retain the last
displayed time after cancellation depending on your terminal emulator. In
`TERM=dumb`/minimal environments, advanced terminal control sequences are disabled.
